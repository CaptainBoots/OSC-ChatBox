ui/worker_utils.py
────────────────────
Shared helper implementing the QObject-relay pattern established while
debugging VRChat-Social-Logger's login dialog: connecting a background
QThread's signal straight to a plain Python closure does NOT reliably
queue the call onto the main thread in PySide6 — only a genuine bound
QObject method does, since AutoConnection (and even an explicit
Qt.QueuedConnection) can only detect "queue this" by inspecting the
*receiver's* .thread(), and a bare closure has none. That silently let
worker-thread code touch widgets directly from a background thread,
which reproducibly aborted the whole process. Full writeup lives in
that project's ui/login_dialog.py, in the _ResultRelay class docstring.

run_worker() does the thread + relay wiring once, correctly, so every
dialog here just gets a plain function to call, a success closure, and
a failure closure — no thread lifecycle code to get wrong per-dialog.
