"""
core/deep_link.py
────────────────────
Builds the vrchat.com URLs used to hand off to the installed VRChat
client, or to just open the relevant page on vrchat.com. VRChat
registers a protocol handler (its own "Installation Helper") that
intercepts these specific URLs and launches the game; if that
registration is missing or broken on someone's machine, the URL just
opens as a normal webpage in their browser instead of silently doing
nothing — vrchat.com's own launch page has a manual "Launch" button too,
so this degrades gracefully either way.

Verified URL shape (matches links VRChat's own site generates, and
what community tools like VRCX use):
    https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=<worldId>&instanceId=<instanceId>

Pure backend, no Qt — ui code calls open_url() directly.
