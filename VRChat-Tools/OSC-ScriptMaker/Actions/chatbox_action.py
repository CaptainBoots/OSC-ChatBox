Action module: sends text either to the real VRChat chatbox
(/chatbox/input on whatever host:port you set — normally VRChat's OSC
in on 127.0.0.1:9000), or to one of 10 custom "channels" — a private
broadcast bus for routing text between your own tools/scripts without
touching VRChat's OSC traffic at all. Each channel is a fixed port far
away from VRChat's own range and any other tool in this suite, so
picking a channel can never collide with something else listening.

Both modes send the same message shape ([text, send_immediately,
play_sfx] to /chatbox/input) — a channel is just "the same kind of
message, delivered somewhere private instead."

"{value}" in the text is replaced with the trigger's value, so e.g.
a script watching a float parameter can chatbox its live value.
