core/Actions/set_connection_action.py
─────────────────────────────────────────
Action module: changes the Listen (incoming) or Send (outgoing) host
and/or port at runtime — the same fields shown in the Scripts tab's
connection bar. Leaving host or port blank keeps that part unchanged.

Changing Listen restarts the OSC listener on the new address; changing
Send just updates the default outgoing host/port that send_osc/chatbox
actions fall back to when they don't specify their own override.
