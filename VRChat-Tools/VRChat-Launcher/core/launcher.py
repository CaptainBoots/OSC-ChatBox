──────────────────
Profile defaults and the VRChat multi-instance process-launching
backend, extracted from the original monolithic VRCLauncherApp.
No Qt/Tk imports here — this only knows about subprocess.Popen,
plain dicts, and os.path.

Profiles carry a stable "uid" separate from their position in the
list. The original Tk version tracked live processes by *list index*,
which silently mis-associates a running process with the wrong
profile the moment any earlier profile is removed (everything after
it shifts down by one). Using a uid that never changes for the
lifetime of a profile fixes that without changing any visible
behaviour.
