"""
core/secure_store.py
──────────────────────
Persists a small secrets blob (for OSC-Chatbox: Spotify OAuth tokens)
using one of three strategies, selectable in Settings
("secure_storage_mode" in config):

  "keyring"         — OS credential store (Windows Credential Manager /
                       macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service) via the
                       `keyring` package. No extra password needed at
                       launch; protected by your OS login session.
  "master_password" — an encrypted blob on disk (AES-256-GCM). The key
                       is derived (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256) from a password
                       typed once per launch — that password itself is
                       NEVER written to disk anywhere, only used
                       in-memory to derive the key each time.
  "none"            — nothing is ever persisted; reconnect Spotify
                       fresh every launch.

Pure backend — no Qt imports here. ui/master_password_dialog.py is the
only place allowed to prompt for the password and call into
password-manager CLIs; this module only ever handles bytes/dicts.

Ported from VRChat Social Logger's identical secure_store.py (same
three-mode design, same encryption scheme) — ONE SecureStore instance
per secret category, distinguished by KEYRING_SERVICE/blob_path, so
this file is intentionally generic rather than Spotify-specific: any
future credential (another API, etc.) can reuse the same class with
its own service name and blob path.
